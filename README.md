# Image Format Converter

This Python script converts images from one format to another and saves the result. It utilizes the `Pillow` library (PIL fork) to handle image processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- `Pillow` library

You can install the `Pillow` library using pip if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cyberguardsajan/image_file_converter.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd image_file_converter
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python image_file_converter.py
    ```

### Provide Input

2. **File Name:** Enter the name of the image file you want to convert (with its current extension).
3. **Change Format To:** Specify the desired format for the converted image (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP).
4. **Output Name:** Enter the desired name for the converted image file (without the extension).

5. The script will convert the image to the specified format and save it with the name you provided.
